    "The purpose of this project is to come up with a model which reads news headlines and interprets them to come up with a prediction of the change in the stock market.  I will use a binary indicator for the stock market movement, with +1 equalling a flat or up day, and 0 indicating a negative day.  Given the binary indicator I will first use Logistic regression, and expand to addtional models after that.  A successful model such as this can be extremely useful in that:\n",
    "- It can be used to provide investors, such as large portfolio managers, an automated way of analyzing a large volume of news information more quickly than an individual can process such information\n",
    "- The investors can then use the prediction to overweight or underweight their portfolios \n",
    "- Even a small improvement beyond a 50/50 chance for an up or down day could be extremely valuable, as a small improvement in investor positioning over time could accumulate to a large improvement in investment returns\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first step of predicting up or down movement, additional steps may include:\n",
    "- Predicting magnitude of up or down movement\n",
    "- Predicting more than 1 day of movement\n",
    "- Predicing patterns of movement, such as up/down/up, up/up/down etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial dataset I will use is from Kaggle, titled Daily News For Stock Market Prediction.  This data includes the following:\n",
    "- A file of news headline data from the range 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01.  The headlines are taken from Reddit WorldNews Channel.  The top 25 headlines for each date are included based on reddit users' votes.\n",
    "- A binary variable showing for each date a 1 if the Dow Jones Industrial Index was flat or positive for the day, and a zero if the DJIA was negative for the day\n"

However, the headlines and the price movements where all contemparaneous: by the time the headline data was available, the price movement had already occured.  This means that as an actual investment signal it comes too late.  The next step to address that is to offset the price movement data by 1 day.  That way, in practice the model could be run each day, before the market closes.  Based on the prediction for the next day's price movement, an investment position can be taken, market on close.  This may be too much pressure to execute each day, as you must wait for the news headlines to be published, run the model, then execute a trade, all within a few minutes prior to the market closing.  If you run the model too early, you risk missing headlines. If you run the model too late, the market has closed.   \n",
