***Project 1: News and Stocks***  
Great project idea! I like this one. Lots of people, and lots of companies, do something of this sort. It may be a bit ambitious to build out something super complex. You may want to consider scaling back to building a model on news articles to model sentiment and or stock-price. That would be a great way to learn many tools!

***Project 2: Commodities Modeling***  
There have been many students that have done something of this nature. I will preface this by noting I am biased against lots of finance data, but I don't know if this is the *best* project to work on. There often is not a lot to work with, and many students get a little lost in some time series modeling or applying some odd non-linear models. However, given you have some background in this area, this may be a solid project for you. If you are committed to it, I am more than happy to support it!


***Project 3: Short-Term Profits***  
This is interesting! I have to admit, I personally do not have a lot of experience modeling this type of short-term price fluctuation data. I do know, though, that there is tons of noise in modeling something like this. A lot of these rapid changes, as you know, are the result of models on models interacting with other models, which doesn't bode well for building on of your own. We will discuss this more, but I see a lot of opportunity for models not generalizing well and fitting to too much noise. But! Depending on the data, you could find out something kind of interesting!

My vote is number 1! But, you may are going to have to grab a good, balanced dataset and ensure that you have an appropriate scope. Is it all news articles? Is it one website? Is it all stocks? How do you want to scale this project?   


*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
