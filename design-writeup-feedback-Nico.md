### ***Design Write-up Feedback***

A great setup for a project! While it is true that this 'field' is not developed, it is definitely an area where many people try their hand. You will definitely have some resources online to base your code on.

***Regarding outcomes, labels, and engineering the problem***  
Outside of actually building an effective, meaningful model, engineering a well structured dataset for this problem will be the greatest challenge. Given this setup, you want to actually have predict labels (or probability vectors) for buy/hold/sell. This is possible, but it begs labeled data, especially in the context of the techniques that we focus on in class. Defining, and labeling, what you should buy/hold/sell is no easy task. Going forward, you will have to construct some mechanism to either label or, what you have indicated previously, develop a very different model that models sentiment, which will be used to predict stock price. We don't go over sentiment analysis much in class, but there are a lot of ways to cut that problem, which may be supervised or unsupervised. Let's talk about it before class, and we can define a more explicit path to your model!
