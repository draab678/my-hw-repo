    "Answer: The analysis illustrates that there is a relatively linear relationship between GPA and admissions, and GRE and admissions, where no matter what level of Prestige your college, the better your scores the better your chances of admission.  That part is certainly encouraging.  The fact that the lower tier colleges rank so significantly below the higher tiers could be very useful information to pre-college applicants, as it helps illustrate the tremendous impact on chances for admission to grad school that the higher tier college could potentially have down the road.
